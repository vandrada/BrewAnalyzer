#BrewAnalyzer

Analyzes the programs that are installed through the Mac OS X package manager
homebrew. It essentially adds some features that I find helpful.

##Mundane Commands
* list programs installed
* list the dependencies of a program
* list the uses of a program(this one is a little different)

##Money Commands (the features I find 'helpful')
* list shared dependencies between two progams
* list shared uses between two uses
* only list programs with uses
* only list programs with dependencies
* list programs with no uses and no dependencies
* list programs that will be broken on the removal of a certain program
